\begin{abstract}
This paper presents a strategy for the control of multiple vehicles that cooperatively transport a flexible payload. To this end, an algorithm is developed which generates optimal trajectories for the vehicles to follow. Solving an optimization problem composes the core of the algorithm. The problem is first decomposed over the vehicles using the Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM) algorithm. This results in each vehicle solving a sub-problem to generate its own optimal trajectory. The algorithm instructs that the optimization problem be solved repeatedly in a receding horizon fashion, making it fit into a distributed model predictive control (DMPC) framework. One ADMM iteration is performed per DMPC iteration, reducing the inter-agent communication rate. Numerical validation of the developed control scheme is performed and the results are presented.

\section{INTRODUCTION}

Payload transportation tasks are ubiquitous in industrial environments. These payloads can vary greatly in weights, necessitating multiple transportation solutions of different payload capacities within the same logistics structure. An alternative to this would be to use multiple vehicles to cooperatively tow a payload, with the number of vehicles chosen according to the towing requirements. To enable such a multi-agent system to work autonomously and transport the payload to a desired location, control strategies are required which perform coordinated motion of the vehicles.
\\
\indent Transportation of objects with multiple vehicles is a standard problem in robotics and control. Some of the early approaches to model and control such systems are presented in \cite{c1,c2,c3}, and an optimal control approach in \cite{c4}. More recent approaches utilize a Model Predictive Control (MPC) framework, which allows to explicity incorporate system constraints in the optimization problem. Such techniques have been applied to perform trajectory tracking with multiple vehicles moving in a desired formation \cite{c5}. Motion planning for multiple vehicles moving in a formation is done within a receding horizon framework in \cite{c6}, utilizing a leader-follower strategy. Such a strategy is not robust against possible failure of the leader agent. This necessitates development of strategies in which each agent performs an equivalent task within the multi-agent system. This leads to the domain of Distributed Model Predictive Control (DMPC). Within the DMPC framework, the control problem is distributed over the agents. Since an optimization problem underlies the MPC framework, DMPC based techniques usually utilize distributed optimization methods to distribute the optimization problem over the agents \cite{c7}. Motion planning algorithms are designed within this framework in \cite{c8} and \cite{c16} for formation control of multiple agents.
\\
\indent
 A major difference between formation control problems and the payload transportation problem is that in the latter, the agents are dynamically coupled. This means that a change in state of one of the agents alters the state of the others. The coupled dynamics act as constraints shared by all the agents within the multi-agent system, and decomposing the centralized problem for DMPC purposes would require decomposing the coupling dynamics constraint. Decoupling of dynamics is done using primal decomposition
 in \cite{c10}, in which, linear systems are considered, and an optimal consensus problem is solved. In optimal consensus problems, multiple optimization variables are driven to the
 same value over iterations. In other words, consensus is achieved between different states of the system. Another approach based on dual decomposition, is discussed in \cite{c11}. In this work, the variable splitting method of \cite{c8} is employed. According to this method, copies of states of a multi-agent system that are not local to a constituent vehicle are introduced as exogenous inputs on the vehicle. More robust methods based on the ADMM are formulated in \cite{c12}, which consider coupled objective functions in addition to coupled nonlinear dynamics. Another alternative is introduced in \cite{c13}, where the
 ADMM-consensus problem introduced in \cite{c14} is combined with the idea of introducing copies of neighboring states from \cite{c11}.
 \\
 \indent
 This work extends the DMPC scheme introduced for the formation control problem in \cite{c16}, to the cooperative payload transportation problem. The main advantage of this scheme is that it achieves a decentralized-consensus in a dynamically coupled system, by decoupling the 2nd ADMM step using a novel variable-copying scheme. In order to reduce the communication and computation load, 1 ADMM iteration is performed per DMPC iteration, and the ADMM iterations are supported by inter-vehicle communication. The proposed scheme is implemented using a spline-based parameterization discussed in \cite{c16}, and a numerical validation of the algorithm is performed.
\\ \indent
Section  II  introduces  the  motion  planning  problem  for
cooperative payload transportation problem, and Section III describes how
this  problem  can  be  solved  in  a  online distributed manner. Results from simulations based on the proposed approach are presented in Section IV, and the results from an experimental validation in Section V.
\section{PROBLEM FORMULATION}
\subsection{System model}
The dynamic system under consideration is modeled as multiple holonomic vehicles attached through 1D spring-damper elements to a common payload. The payload and the holonomic vehicles are abstracted as point masses, and are constrained to move in a 2D plane. Dynamic spring-mass-damper models are used to describe the system in the optimization problem. Coloumb friction is ignored in the model. The free length of the flexible elements is assumed to be $0$ m, resulting in the vehicles only applying a pulling force on the payload. A schematic of this model is shown in Figure \ref{2D_schematic}. The case of $N$=3 vehicles is considered here.

  \caption{Dynamic model decoupling}
  \label{2D_schematic}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Optimal control problem}
This section discusses the formulation of optimal control problem. The optimization variables are the payload and the vehicle trajectories. The solution of this problem are the trajectories that transport the payload to a location closest to its goal $x_d \in \mathbb{R}^2$ within the time horizon $T$ over which the problem is solved.
The payload trajectory is represented by the vector ${x_0[0,T] \in \mathbb{R}^2}$ and that of each vehicle $i$ by ${x_i[0,T] \in \mathbb{R}^2}$.
 The formulation is shown in \eqref{label:central}.
\begin{equation}
  \label{label:central}
  \begin{aligned}
    & \minimize_{x_0(.),x_1(.),x_2(.),x_3(.)} \qquad \mathlarger{\int_0^T} \mathlarger{||}x_0(t)-x_d\mathlarger{||}_1 dt \\
    & \qquad \subj
     \qquad \text{  } g(x_0(t),x_1(t),x_2(t),x_3(t)) = 0 \\
    &	\qquad  \qquad \qquad \quad \quad \quad h_{ij}(x_0(t),x_i(t),x_j(t)) \leq 0 \\
    &	\qquad  \qquad \qquad \quad \quad \quad \ubar{l} \preceq f_i(x_0(t),x_i(t)) \preceq \bar{l}\\   
    &	\qquad  \qquad \qquad \quad \quad \quad d_i(x_i(t)) \preceq \bar{d} \\
    &	\qquad  \qquad \qquad \quad \quad \quad x_0^{(k)}(0) = x_{0,0}^{(k)}, \quad x_i^{(k)}(0) = x_{0,i}^{(k)} \\
       &	 \qquad \qquad \qquad \quad \quad \quad x_0^{(k)}(T) = x_{T,0}^{(k)} , \quad x_i^{(k)}(T) = x_{T,i}^{(k)} \\
       &	 \qquad \qquad \qquad \quad \quad \quad k\in{0,1,2} \\
    &	 \qquad \qquad \qquad \quad \quad \quad \forall t \in [0,T], \quad \forall i,j \in \{1,2,3\}, i \neq j
  \end{aligned}
\end{equation}
As mentioned earlier, the coupled payload dynamics of the multi-agent system are modeled as constraints in the optimization problem. It is expressed in \eqref{g}. Note that the time dependence of the trajectories is dropped from \eqref{g} till \eqref{f} for ease of notation.The parameters $m_i$ and $m_0$ represent vehicle $i$'s and payload's mass respectively, and $c_i$ and $k_i$ represent damping and stiffness coefficients of flexible element $i$. 
\begin{equation}\label{g}
\begin{aligned}
g(x_0,x_1,x_2,x_3) &= m_0\ddot{x}_0 +  \mathlarger{\sum\limits_{i=1}^{3}}
\begin{bmatrix}{c_i(\dot{x}_i-\dot{x}_0) + k_i(x_i - x_0)} \end{bmatrix}\\
\end{aligned}
\end{equation}
\noindent
Intra-vehicle collisions are avoided by the function $h_{ij}$, expressed in \eqref{h}. It limits the angles between the vehicles to lie at greater than 90$\degree$ when subtended at the payload. Unlike the complete coupled constraint $g$, this is a constraint involving nearest neighbors.
 \begin{equation}\label{h}
\begin{aligned}
h_{ij}(x_0,x_i,x_j) &= \mathlarger{\langle} x_i - x_0,x_j - x_0 \mathlarger{\rangle}
\end{aligned}
\end{equation}
The function $f_i$ consists of individual vehicle $i$'s dynamics, and flexible element $i$'s length. The lower and upper bounds on these quantities are captured in vectors $\ubar{l}$ and $\bar{l}$ respectively. This function is shown in \eqref{f}. 
 \begin{equation}\label{f}
 \begin{aligned}
 f_i(x_0,x_i) &=
 \begin{bmatrix}
   m_i\ddot{x}_i + c_i(\dot{x}_i-\dot{x}_0) + k_i(x_i-x_0) \\
  \mathlarger{\langle} x_i - x_0,x_i - x_0 \mathlarger{\rangle}
 \end{bmatrix} \\
 \end{aligned}
 \end{equation}
 Absolute values of vehicle velocities and accelerations are expressed through the function $d_i$ shown in \eqref{d}, with the limits on these quantities captured in the vector $\bar{d}$.
 \begin{equation}\label{d}
 \begin{aligned}
 d_i(x_i) &=
 \begin{bmatrix}
  \mathlarger{|}\dot{x_i}\mathlarger{|}^T &\mathlarger{|}\ddot{x_i}\mathlarger{|}^T
 \end{bmatrix}^T \\
 \end{aligned}
 \end{equation}
 The rest of the constraints represent limits on vehicle velocities and accelerations, and initial and final conditions on the vehicle and payload position trajectories and higher derivatives.
\section{Solution strategy}
\subsection{Spline parameterization}
Problem \eqref{label:central} represents an infinite dimensional problem, since the optimization variables $x_0(.)$ and $x_i(.)$ are infinite dimensional, and enforcing the constraints at all time results in an infinite number of constraints. In order to make the problem numerically tractable, a B-spline based parameterization of the optimization variables is used, along the lines of \cite{c15}. The continuous optimization variables are hence represented as linear combinations of piecewise polynomial B-spline basis functions $b_k(t)$, as expressed in \eqref{spline}.

\begin{equation}\label{spline}
x_i(t) = \mathlarger{\sum\limits_{k=1}^{n}} \cx_{i,k}b_k(t) = \cx_i^Tb(t) \quad \forall i \in \{0,1,.,N\}
\end{equation}

 The trajectories of each vehicle $i$ are consequently represented by the coefficient set $\cx_i$$=$ $\{\cx_{i,k}\}_{k=1}^{n}$ and those of the payload by $\cx_0$$=$$\{\cx_{0,k}\}_{k=1}^{n}$, for a chosen B-spline basis functions vector $b = [b_1,\ldots,b_n]^T$. Substituting these parameterizations in \eqref{label:central} results in an optimization problem with finite number of variables. A B-spline parameterization is chosen because of its convex hull property \cite{c15}, which dictates that the resultant spline function lies within the convex hull of the coefficients. Hence, the constraints on an infinite dimensional spline can be imposed on the coefficients of the corresponding B-spline basis functions, resulting in a finite number of constraints. Since the constraint functions $f_i$,$g$ and $h_{ij}$ are composed of polynomial combinations of the splines $x_i(t)$ and $x_0(t)$ and their derivatives, the resultant functions are splines in a B-spline polynomial basis as well. The coefficients of these splines are polynomial combinations of $\cx_0$ and $\cx_i$. Following the convex hull property, these constraints are transformed to $\cf_i$,$\cg$ and $\ch_{ij}$ respectively, indicated in a sans-serif font.
The resultant formulation is seen in \eqref{withparam}. 

 \begin{equation}
   \label{withparam}
   \begin{aligned}
     & \minimize_{\forall i:\cx_i,\cx_0} &&  \J(\cx_0) \\
     & \subj
     &      & \cg(\cx_0,\cx_1,\cx_2,\cx_3) = 0 \\
     &        && \ch_{ij}(\cx_0,\cx_i,\cx_j) \leq 0 \\
     &	&& \ubar{l} \preceq \cf_i(\cx_0,\cx_i) \preceq \bar{l}\\
     &        && \cx_i \in \X_i \\
     &        && \cx_0 \in \X_0 \\
     &                                && \forall i,j \in \{1,2,3\}, i \neq j
   \end{aligned}
 \end{equation}
 The MPC updating scheme proposed in \cite{c16} for optimization variables expressed in a B-spline basis can be used on a centralized processor, provided it has access to all $\cx_i$ and $\cx_0$ variables. This scheme is summarized in Algorithm~\ref{alg:mpc}. The vehicle and payload positions estimated at time $(k+1)\Delta T$ are incorporated into the feasible sets $\X_i$ and $\X_0$ while solving the problem for $\cx_i^{k+1}$ and $\cx_0^{k+1}$.

 \end{algorithmic}
 \end{algorithm}


 \subsection{Distributed formulation}
 The purpose of this section is to split the optimization problem \eqref{withparam} into 3 separate problems, one for each vehicle. This allows each vehicle to solve for its own trajectory, with the solution procedure being aided by communication between the vehicles. The first step towards the distributed formulation is the introduction of copies of the payload variables $\cx_0$ on each vehicle. These variables are represented by $\cx_{i0}$. The substitution of these variables results in 3 copies of the payload dynamics constraint $\cg$, each one being $\cg(\cx_{i0},\cx_i,\cx_j) = 0$, where $\cx_j = \{\cx_1,\cx_2,\cx_3\}\ominus \cx_i$.
 \\ \indent
 The payload dynamics constraint is further decoupled by borrowing ideas from \cite{c11}, which dictates that the variables $x_{j}(t)$ of vehicle $j$ which affect the dynamics of vehicle $i$ can be modeled as exogenous inputs $x_{ij}(t)$ acting on vehicle $i$. The new variables $x_{ij}(t)$ are hence local to vehicle $i$, and are parameterized by the spline coefficients $\cx_{ij}$. The payload dynamics constraint is thus further modified as $\cg(\cx_{i0},\cx_i,\cx_{ij}) = 0$. This substitution is supported by consensus constraints between  $\cx_{j}$ and $\cx_{ij}$. Similar substitutions are performed in the anti-collision constraints $\ch_{ij}$. Following a modification of the consensus constraints presented in \cite{c9}, consensus variables $\cz_{ij}$ are introduced on each vehicle $i$, which act as a balance between $\cx_{j}$ and $\cx_{ij}$. The modified optimization problem with local copy variables, consensus variables, and consensus constraints is shown in \eqref{main_problem}.
   \begin{equation}
     \label{main_problem}
     \begin{aligned}
       & \minimize_{\forall i,j,i \neq j:\cx_i,\cx_{ij},\cz_{ij},\cx_{i0}} &&  \sum\limits_{i=1}^{3}\J(\cx_{i0}) \\
       & \subj
       && \ubar{l} \preceq \cf_i(\cx_{i0},\cx_i) \preceq \bar{l}\\
       &       && \cg(\cx_{i0},\cx_i,\cx_{ij}) = 0 \\
       &        && \ch_{ij}(\cx_{i0},\cx_i,\cx_{ij}) \leq 0 \\
       &         && \cx_{ij} = \cz_{ij},\, \cx_{j} = \cz_{ij} \\
       &        && \cx_i \in \X_i,\, \cx_{i0} \in \X_0 \\
       &                                && \forall i,j \in \{1,2,3\}, i \neq j
     \end{aligned}
   \end{equation}

  \indent
 The optimization problem \eqref{main_problem} can now be decoupled using the Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM). The ADMM algorithm solves the dual of \eqref{main_problem}, after augumenting it with a quadratic term to improve convergence properties. To minimize duality gap, the fewest number of constraints are dualized according to \cite{c8}. Hence, only the consensus equality constraints are moved into the objective function to form the lagrangian:


 \begin{equation}\label{Lagrangian}
   \begin{aligned}
   \mathcal{L}_\rho &=
  {\mathlarger{\sum\limits_{i=1}^{3}}}
  {\mathlarger{\mathlarger{(}}}\J_i(\cx_{i0}) +
 \mathlarger{\sum\limits_{j \neq i}} \mathlarger{(} \lambda_{ij}^T(\cx_{ij} - \cz_{ij}) + \cfrac{\rho}{2} \mathlarger{||}\cx_{ij} - \cz_{ij}\mathlarger{||}_2^2{{\mathlarger{)}}} \\ & \qquad \qquad \qquad
  + \mathlarger{\sum\limits_{j \neq i}} \mathlarger{(} \mu_{ij}^T(\cx_{j} - \cz_{ij}) +
   \cfrac{\rho}{2} \mathlarger{||}\cx_{j} - \cz_{ij}\mathlarger{||}_2^2 \mathlarger{)}\mathlarger{\mathlarger{\mathlarger{)}}}
   \\
   &= {\mathlarger{\sum\limits_{i=1}^{3}}}  \mathcal{L}_{\rho,i} (\cx_{i0},\cx_{ij},\cz_{ij},\lambda_{ij},\cx_{j},\cz_{ij},\mu_{ij}) \\
   &= {\mathlarger{\sum\limits_{i=1}^{3}}}  \mathcal{L}_{\rho,i} (\cx_{i0},\cx_{ij},\cz_{ij},\lambda_{ij},\cx_{i},\cz_{ji},\mu_{ji})
   \end{aligned}
   \end{equation}
The dual variables introduced in the Lagrangian corresponding to the equality constraints are $\lambda_{ij}$ and $\mu_{ij}$. The last equality in \eqref{Lagrangian} is valid due to the bidirectionality of interaction amongst the vehicles: variables on vehicle $i$ affecting the dynamics of vehicle $j$ correspond to the variables on vehicle $j$ affecting dynamics of vehicle $i$.
Since the constraints are now completely decoupled, the feasible set on each vehicle $i$ is represented by $\{\cx_{i},\cx_{i0},\cx_{ij}\} \in \Phi_i$. The dual function of \eqref{main_problem} is shown in \eqref{dual_problem}.
\begin{equation}\label{dual_problem}
q(\lambda_{ij},\mu_{ij}) = \inf_{\substack{\{\cx_{i},\cx_{i0},\cx_{ij}\} \in \Phi_i \\ \forall i,j \in \{1,2,3\}, i \neq j}} \mathcal{L}_{\rho}\
\end{equation}

The dual variables are found by maximizing the dual function $q$ with respect to the lagrangian multipliers. The maximization is performed through gradient ascent in the ADMM algorithm. For this, the primal variables $\cx_{ij}^k$,$\cx_{j}^k$ and $\cz_{ij}^k$ from iteration $k$ are updated in iteration $k+1$, and the gradient of the dual function $q$ is calculated in the directions of the lagrangian multipliers according to \eqref{gradients}.
\begin{equation}\label{gradients}
  \begin{aligned}
    \nabla_{\lambda_{ij}} q    &= \cx_{ij}^{k+1} - \cz_{ij}^{k+1}\\
    \nabla_{\mu_{ij}} q &= \cx_{j}^{k+1} - \cz_{ij}^{k+1}
  \end{aligned}
\end{equation}
 An optimal step of length $\rho$ in these directions is taken. The primal variables are updated in two steps in a Gauss-Siedel fashion, the first step updating the $\{\cx_{i},\cx_{i0},\cx_{ij}\}$ variables and the second updating the $\cz_{ij}$ variables.
\\
\indent
Solving the optimization problem \eqref{withparam} till convergence will require several ADMM iterations. These iterations will replace~(step 5) in Algorithm~\ref{alg:mpc}, and would be performed on individual vehicles in parallel. However, this would also result in a substantial computation and communication load for each MPC iteration. This is avoided by following the DMPC scheme proposed in \cite{c16}, which performs 1 ADMM iteration per MPC iteration. The resultant is Algorithm~\ref{alg:dmpc}, which includes the communication steps performed in one DMPC iteration.

The algorithm dictates that first, a few ADMM iterations be performed to find the first set of primal and dual variables. The primal $\cx_{i}$ variables are then interpreted in terms of the trajectories $x_i(t)$ on each vehicle $i$, and the tracking of these trajectories begins. According to the spline-MPC scheme discussed in \cite{c16}, $\hat{x}_i(\Delta T)$ and $\hat{x}_{i0}(\Delta T)$ are estimated locally on each vehicle, with perfectly tracked $x_{ij}(t)$ as the exogenous inputs into the local model. These estimates are passed as initial conditions into the MPC problem solving the trajectories from time $\Delta T$. This is followed by the usual 3 ADMM steps, with steps 7 and 9 for calculating the primal variables, and step 10 for the dual variables. Since variables from the previous ADMM iteration are used in the current iteration, the spline coefficients are transformed to represent the spline in the current time frame, as discussed in \cite{c16}. Step 6 of the algorithm deals with this transformation. Step 9 is the direct least squares solution of the second ADMM step to update the $\cz_{ij}$ variables, and the corresponding problem is shown in \eqref{z_step}.
\begin{equation}
\label{z_step}
\begin{aligned} \cz_{ij}^{k+1} &:=
 \argmin_{\cz_{ij}} \quad (\tilde{\lambda}^k_{ij})^T(\cx^{k+1}_{ij} - \cz_{ij}) + \cfrac{\rho}{2} \mathlarger{||}\cx^{k+1}_{ij} - \cz_{ij}\mathlarger{||}_2^2{{}} \\ & \qquad \quad \quad \quad
+ (\tilde{\mu}^k_{ij})^T(\cx^{k+1}_{j} - \cz_{ij}) +
\cfrac{\rho}{2} \mathlarger{||}\cx^{k+1}_{j} - \cz_{ij}\mathlarger{||}_2^2 \mathlarger{}
\end{aligned}
\end{equation}
\\
\indent
From this least squares problem, it can be seen the consensus variables $\cz_{ij}$ are pushed between the \textit{expected} $\cx_{ij}$ variables and the \textit{actual} $\cx_j$ variables, acting as a balance between them. In the first ADMM step (Step 7), the reverse occurs in that $\cx_{ij}$ and $\cx_j$ are pushed towards the previous \textit{compromise} $\cz_{ij}$ variables. Thus, over MPC (and hence, ADMM) iterations, a consensus is achieved between $\cx_{ij}$ and $\cx_j$, resulting the problem dynamics being satisfied.

\section{Simulation results}
The DMPC strategy proposed in Algorithm~\ref{alg:dmpc} is numerically validated for the multi-agent system with parameters as follows:

 		Parameters &

	\caption{Motion trajectories for the payload and holonomic vehicles within the multi-agent system. The dotted lines represent payload trajectory. The gray lines indicate the computed trajectories to follow. The black lines represent the covered paths.}
	\label{trajectories}
\end{figure*}
The velocities and accelerations of the vehicles are enforced to start from 0$m/s$ and 0$m/s^2$ respectively. The initial positions have been chosen such that the payload starts from a balanced state. The vehicle and payload trajectories are parameterized as B-splines with cubic basis functions having 10 knot intervals. The time horizon is $T$ = 5s, and each DMPC update happens every $\Delta T$ = 0.1s. The ADMM penalty parameter is $\rho$ = 0.5. The spline coefficients are defined as CasADi symbols. The optimization problem in step 7 of Algorithm~\ref{alg:dmpc} is solved using the interior point solver IPOPT, for which the exact Jacobians and Hessians are provided by CasADi. The initial conditions for each DMPC update in the simulations are obtained following the assumption of perfect tracking of trajectories calculated in the previous DMPC update by the vehicles.

The motion trajectories of the vehicles and payload upon implementation of Algorithm~\ref{alg:dmpc} to control the multi-agent system are shown in Figure \ref{trajectories}. The darker lines represent trajectories that have been traversed by the vehicles and payload, and the lighter lines represent future trajectories. The corresponding velocity trajectories tracked by the vehicles are shown in Figure \ref{velocities}. The velocities do not reach their limit of 1 m/s. This is because the lagrangian function also tries to attain consensus between expected and actual vehicle trajectories in addition to pushing the payload towards the goal location.

	\includegraphics[scale=0.50]{figures/velocities.pdf}

\end{figure}

 Reducing the value of ADMM penalty parameter $\rho$ increases the vehicle velocities, but the dynamics get violated due to a lack of consensus. 
Since consensus constraints such as $\cx_{i0} = \cx_{j0}$ are not imposed, the payload positions are free to evolve according to the local dynamics of each vehicle. However, the complete multi-agent system dynamics are satisfied only if the local payload position copies converge towards each other. Hence, convergence of local payload positions towards each other over successive ADMM iterations is an indicator dynamics satisfaction. This convergence is monitored by using distance metrics between the payload trajectory coefficients $\cx_{10}$, $\cx_{20}$ and $\cx_{30}$,  calculating a measure of dynamics error $\epsilon_0$ as:
\begin{equation}
\epsilon_0 = \mathlarger{\sum_{i=1}^{3}} \mathlarger{\sum_{j \neq i}} \mathlarger{\langle} \cx_{i0} - \cx_{j0},\cx_{i0} - \cx_{j0} \mathlarger{\rangle}
\end{equation}
For the trajectories shown in Figure \ref{trajectories}, the corresponding $\epsilon_{0}$ is shown in Figure \ref{error}.
\begin{figure}[H]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[scale=0.40]{figures/epsilon.pdf}
	\caption{Error in system dynamics.}

\end{figure}

\begin{figure*}[h]
	\centering
	\setlength{\tabcolsep}{0.1em}
	\begin{tabular}[t]{rrrrr}
		\includegraphics[scale=0.80]{figures/obstacle.pdf}
	\end{tabular}
	\caption{Motion trajectories of the vehicles and payload in the presence of a stationary obstacle.}
	\label{obstacle}
\end{figure*}
Since all vehicles start with the same initial value of the payload position, the coefficients match resulting in $\epsilon_0$=0. However, the local payload copies diverge from each other during the initial few DMPC iterations, and before halt of the payload. This is because each vehicle $i$ is agnostic of each other vehicle $j$'s force limits. At the start, the vehicle $i$ requests a trajectory $\cx_{ij}$ of vehicle $j$ which results in an immediate pull of the payload with a high force. Towards the end, the opposite occurs with each vehicle $i$ requesting a $\cx_{ij}$ pulling the payload to an immediate halt. However, vehicle $j$ can
 realistically only provide a trajectory $\cx_j$ while respecting its own constraints. This trajectory is different from the requested $\cx_{ij}$, resulting in a lack of consensus. This leads to an increase in disagreement about the payload position between the vehicles, increasing the value of $\epsilon_0$. This disagreement is however penalized through the consensus variables $\cz_{ij}$, and dual variables $\lambda_{ij}$ and $\mu_{ij}$. The penalization results in the vehicles achieving consensus over the payload position over successive DMPC iterations, reducing the value of $\epsilon_0$. Hence, it is concluded that the dynamics of the complete multi-agent system are satisfied. The number of iterations after which consensus is achieved can be reduced by increasing the value of the ADMM penalty parameter $\rho$. However, this results in lower vehicle velocities indicating a loss in optimality with respect to payload transportation.
 
 \section{Conclusion and future work}
This paper presents an algorithm to solve the multi-vehicle payload transportation problem in a Distributed Model Predictive Control (DMPC) framework. The optimization problem underlying the control problem is decoupled over the multiple vehicles based on the Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM).
